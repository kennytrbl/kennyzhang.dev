# kennyzhang.dev

A personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, experience, and skills as a software engineer.

The goal was to create a visually appealing and accessible website that effectively highlights my technical expertise and past work. I focused on providing a clean and modern user experience, ensuring easy navigation across different sections such as projects, resume, and contact information. The website is hosted on Vercel for fast and reliable deployment.
